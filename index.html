<h3 class="center">About Me</h3>
<p class="indent">
I made my debut programming in the spring of 2018. I was in 8th grade.
In the fall of that school year, I took a programming class.
I found the class quite enjoyable, but it was nothing special.
Our last project for that class was the teacher walking us through how to make a simple hangman game in Python.
We copied the code for it from the board, but for some reason mine didn't work.
Ultimately, I returned to programming because that hangman game didnt work and I needed to know why.

Early on, programming came with much difficulty to me.
My code would always be riddled with bugs, some of which were tricky to fix.
Thankfully, my father helped me through it.
Whenever I had problems with my program I would go to him. 
I would explain what I wanted to do and describe the problem I was having.
It was incredibly helpful.
Sometimes just saying it out loud would clue me in to the problem.
Other times he would provide some feedback that would help me.
Eventually I would become independent of him.

Also in the spring of 2018, I got Minecraft: Java Edition for my birthday. At one point, I was making a minigames server with my friends, the functionality of which relied completely on redstone and command blocks. With the introduction of datapacks in 1.13, I was so excited that everything could be migrated and I wouldnt need to worry about chunks being loaded.
