In AP Computer Science A, we were challenged to make a game as our final project to test the knowledge and skills that we gained throughout the year.
We could have made a platformer game using starter code provided by our teacher.
However, my partner and I decided to challenge ourselves and make this asteroid mining game from scratch.
As you can see here, the game has generated asteroids around the map for the player to fly around in the mine.
From there the player will head back to the space station to sell their materials and purchase upgrades for their ship.
While doing this, the player must defend against enemies (the black ships) seeking to destroy them.
